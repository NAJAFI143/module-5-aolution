  After doing time in North Carolina, Charles began selling crack near an Army base on the Kentucky-Tennessee border. He was busted, and convicted in 1996 of selling crack and illegal gun possession. Those were federal offenses, subject to strict mandatory-minimum drug sentencing guidelines that added time for so-called “career offenders.” A judge sentenced him to 35 years to life.

Charles was, by all accounts, a model inmate, with a record of zero disciplinary infractions. In 2010, after President Barack Obama signed a law reducing penalties for crack offenses, Charles applied for early release. A judge, believing Charles was eligible, shaved 14 years off his sentence, and in early 2016 he was released.

He ended up in Nashville, where he rebuilt his life, got back in touch with his family and began volunteering at a food pantry. But as that was happening, prosecutors challenged Charles’ early release, saying that as a “career offender” he wasn’t eligible. An appeals court agreed, and in March U.S. District Court Judge Aleta Trauger ordered him back to jail to finish his original sentence.</p> </div>
